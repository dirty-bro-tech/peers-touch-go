# [WIP]Go-Peer-touch

An implementation of the [W3C ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) protocol in Go.

## Why This Project

We all now are living in a world under the control of the huge companies. We have to submit our personal info to them.
We want to build a world without AI, BigData. Human in this world respect each other's private info. No man analyze our data in the place we don't know.
No one can pry into our personal life and trace any private things.


## Design

### Structure Model
> Here only representative modules are listed.

### MVP Flow
> This is essentially a demo to confirm the feasibility of our solution.

## Features

* Registry: In addition to being able to register with discovery nodes, it can also operate as a discovery node. <br />
* Config-Driven: The configuration file is used to configure the whole options.  <br />
